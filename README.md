# Botium-Toys - Security Audit
## A general description of the system or project:
In this activity provided by Google Cybersecurity Certifications Program, I conducted an internal security audit to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect Botium Toysâ€™s business continuity and critical assets.

## A guide to installation and use
I used Google Docs (see links to activity tasks below) to fill out the activities provided so there was no installations were required.

## What did I learn?
I learnt about compliance regulations and standards in regards to the NIST CSF AND NIST RMF both which provide frameworks and guidelines for organisations to follow 
I also learnt about 3 main control categories such as: Adminstrative/Managerial controls, Technical controls and Physical controls.
I kept the scopes and goals of Botium in mind to make decisions about the controls assessment and the compliance checklist.
